    "\n",
    "You're a busy professional who needs to manage a list of contacts efficiently. To streamline this process, you've developed a Contact Management System in Python. This system allows you to add, update, delete, and view contacts effortlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the Contact Management System works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding Contacts: When you run the program, it welcomes you and presents a menu. If you choose to add a contact, you provide the contact's name, phone number, and email address. The program then adds this contact to your list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating Contacts: If you need to update a contact's information, you can select this option from the menu. You provide the contact's name along with the updated phone number and/or email address. The program updates the contact's information accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting Contacts: You can also choose to delete a contact from your list. Simply enter the name of the contact you wish to delete, and the program removes it from your list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Viewing Contacts: If you want to see the details of a specific contact, you can select this option from the menu. Enter the name of the contact, and the program displays their phone number and email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exiting: When you're done managing your contacts, you can choose to exit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this Contact Management System, you can stay organized and keep track of your contacts effectively, ensuring you can reach out to them whenever needed."
