    "Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "You run a small retail business and manage your inventory using a CSV file. To streamline your inventory management process, you've developed a Python program that allows you to add new products, update product quantities, and generate inventory reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the program works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding Products: When you start the program, you're presented with a menu. If you choose to add a new product, you enter the product details including ID, name, quantity, and price. The program then adds this product to your inventory CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating Quantities: If you need to update the quantity of an existing product, you can select this option from the menu. You provide the product ID and the new quantity. The program updates the quantity of the specified product in the inventory CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating Reports: You can also choose to generate an inventory report. This option displays a summary of all products in your inventory, including their ID, name, quantity, and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exiting: Finally, when you're done managing your inventory, you can choose to exit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this inventory management tool, you can easily keep track of your products, make necessary updates, and generate reports to monitor your inventory levels. It helps you efficiently manage your retail operations, ensuring that you have the right products in stock to meet customer demands."
