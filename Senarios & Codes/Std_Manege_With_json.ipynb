    "Scenario: Building a Student Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "You've been tasked with creating a simple student management system using Python. The system should be able to add new students, display student details, and save student data to a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of what needs to be done:\n",
    "\n",
    "Student Class: Create a Student class to represent each student. Each student should have attributes like name, age, grade, and student ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add Students: Implement a function to add new students to the system. This function should take input from the user for the student's details and create a new Student object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Display Student Details: Implement a function to display the details of a particular student. The user should be able to search for a student by their ID and view all their details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save Data to JSON: After adding students, save all the student data to a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load Data from JSON: Implement a function to load student data from the JSON file when the program starts."
