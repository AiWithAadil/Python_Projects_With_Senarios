    "You're a busy professional trying to stay organized amidst your hectic schedule. To keep track of your tasks efficiently, you've developed a simple task management tool in Python. With this tool, you can add, view, mark as completed, and delete tasks with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you start your day, you open up your Python program. It presents you with a menu of options:\n",
    "\n",
    "Add Task: You can input a new task to be added to your task list.\n",
    "View Task: You can view all the tasks currently on your list.\n",
    "Mark Task: You can mark a task as completed once you've finished it.\n",
    "Delete Task: You can remove a task from your list if it's no longer relevant.\n",
    "Exit: If you're done managing tasks, you can choose to exit the program.\n",
    "You decide to start by adding your tasks for the day. One by one, you input each task into the program. As you progress through your day, you periodically check your task list to see what needs to be done next. When you complete a task, you mark it as done to keep your list up to date. If you no longer need to do a task, you simply delete it from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool helps you stay organized and focused, ensuring that you tackle your tasks efficiently and never miss a beat in your busy schedule."
