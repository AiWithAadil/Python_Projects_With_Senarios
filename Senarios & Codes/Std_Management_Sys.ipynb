    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a teacher at a local high school. At the end of each semester, you're responsible for assessing and grading your students' performance in three core subjects: Maths, English, and Science. To streamline this process, you've developed a Python program that allows you to input the data for each student, calculate their average score, assign a corresponding grade, and analyze the class's overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the semester comes to a close, you gather your class roster and sit down with your laptop to run the program. You input the number of students and start entering their names and respective scores in the three subjects. With each entry, the program automatically calculates the student's average score and assigns a grade based on predefined criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've inputted all the data, the program presents a neat summary of each student's performance, displaying their average score and grade. This helps you quickly identify high-performing students and those who may need extra support.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the program doesn't stop there. It also provides valuable statistical analysis, giving you insights into the overall performance of the class. You can easily see the class average, the highest and lowest scores, and the distribution of grades among the students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with this comprehensive overview, you can make informed decisions about your teaching strategies, identify areas where the class excelled or struggled, and provide personalized support to each student as needed. This Python program has become an invaluable tool in managing and assessing your students' progress, ensuring they receive the best possible education."
