    "Scenario: Online Bookstore Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with developing an Online Bookstore Management System using Python. The system should allow users to browse, search, add to cart, and purchase books. Additionally, the system should have functionality for managing inventory, tracking orders, and generating reports. Here's a breakdown of the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Book: Represents a single book with attributes such as title, author, price, ISBN, and quantity.\n",
    "User: Represents a user of the system with attributes like name, email, and address.\n",
    "Order: Represents a user's order with details like order ID, list of books ordered, total price, and status.\n",
    "Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "search_books(keyword): Function to search for books based on a keyword or phrase.\n",
    "add_to_cart(book_id, quantity): Function to add a specific quantity of a book to the user's shopping cart.\n",
    "remove_from_cart(book_id, quantity): Function to remove a specific quantity of a book from the user's shopping cart.\n",
    "place_order(user_id): Function to place an order for the books currently in the user's shopping cart.\n",
    "generate_report(): Function to generate sales report, inventory report, etc.\n",
    "Dicts:\n",
    "\n",
    "inventory: A dictionary where keys are book IDs and values are instances of the Book class representing the available inventory.\n",
    "users: A dictionary where keys are user IDs and values are instances of the User class representing registered users of the system.\n",
    "orders: A dictionary where keys are order IDs and values are instances of the Order class representing placed orders.\n",
    "Other features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication and authorization mechanisms to handle user login and access control.\n",
    "Error handling for invalid inputs, out-of-stock items, etc.\n",
    "CRUD operations for managing inventory, users, and orders.\n",
    "Integration with a payment gateway for processing transactions.\n",
    "Logging functionality to track system activities.\n",
    "With these components in place, users should be able to interact with the Online Bookstore Management System efficiently, browse through available books, add them to their cart, place orders, and manage their accounts. Admins should have the ability to manage inventory, view sales reports, and perform other administrative tasks."
